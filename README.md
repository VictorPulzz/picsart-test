## About project

In this project, I tried to cover as many different features as possible. 
I used redux-toolkit rtk for requests, made a test server based on miragejs.
Tailwind + scss was used for layout.
Made 3 pages with a table and pagination. 
Also added the ability to add users and hot refresh after adding.
Added detail page for user with request to fake mock server.
